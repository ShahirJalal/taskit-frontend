# Task Organizing App
Welcome to the Task Organizing App! This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for managing tasks. Users can add, edit, and delete their tasks, set statuses, and indicate urgency levels. The application is built with Angular and PrimeNG on the frontend, Spring Boot on the backend, and PostgreSQL for database management. The app is deployed on Heroku.
